* Click on the "Web Sharing" tab.
* Click on the "Share this folder" radio button, which pops a window.
* Pick an alias you want, and set the application permisisons to "Execute".

Alternatively, use the Internet Services Manager applet to add a new Virtual Directory for the Noodle folder.

There will be a folder "inc" with a file "config.inc".
Edit inc/config.inc to rename your wiki and choose between storing pages as files or in an Access database.
